# LookAlive

A guessing game like you've never seen before.

## Prerequisites
- An iOS device
- Safari

> Apologies to any Android users! Support may be available in the future.

## Installation
1. Open Safari.
2. Visit [Look Alive](https://ryankrawz.github.io/look-alive/).
3. Tap the share button, which looks something like :arrow_up:.
4. Select the option `Add to Home Screen`.
5. Locate **Look Alive** on your home screen and open the app. You're all set.

## Gameplay
The player should hold the screen away from themselves so as not to see the word being displayed. While the rest of the group provides hints, the player can indicate a skip or a correct answer by touching different halves of the screen. **In order to signal "Correct" or "Skip", you must hold that half of the screen for 0.5 seconds**. Cheers!
